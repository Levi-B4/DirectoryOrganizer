# DirectoryOrganizer (Still in production)

## Description
Organizes a directory in a user specified way. Can be ran directly or ran from the command line to pass a directory path as an argument.

## Inspiration
I have a friend wanting to learn python, so Im doing a project with him to help him learn. This is the project he chose.

## How to Run
- Install python 3.11 or later
- Run in terminal using `python DirectoryOrganizer.py` appending a directory path as an argument if wanted.
- TestDirectory is not part of the program, but is a viable testing ground for the organizer
